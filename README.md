# The Interesting Times Gang (ITG) Project

## Mission  

The mission of this project is to build the most advanced AI systems on earth and make sure that those systems are truly open for everyone.

## Vision

We see a world where Human Level Machine Intelligence (HLMI) will happen, in that world we see, HMLI belongs to all human kind and it is designed to collaborate with us humans in making life better for everyone.

## Values

- **Open**,  We understand that a technology as powerful as HLMI comes with various risks, for such risks to be controlled; MLMI should be in the hands of all instead of a few. Everyone is welcome to equally participate and  everything produced here, will be 100% Open and Transparent to the public.

- **Harmless**, Nothing that we produce should be designed with the intention of deliberately harming anyone, regardless of their religious beliefs, socio-economic status, gender or race.


## Tactics

A better alternative to OpenAI. Eventually there will be multiple projects that make up this innitiative, however, we will start with one. A model that is better than what OpenAI and alike have produced, where the data used to train the model as well trained model will be truly open.

### Distributed, Sparse and Elastic

In order to train a very large model, we would like to engineer the machanics that can distribute the model computing across many participants. We believe this is possible if the model is both sparse and elastic. A growing composition of many smaller models, that like in the brain, not all the model needs to be computed all the time.


For instance, today it is possible to run a 1 billion parameter model in a computer of  X capacity. A model that reaches 100Trillion paramenters (roughly the ammount of parameters in the human brain) can be made of 100k smaller models, distributed across 10k computers.
